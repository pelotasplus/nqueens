📌 Problem Statement

Build an Android application where the player plays a puzzle game based on the N-Queens problem.
The user’s goal is to place n queens on an nxn chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (no same row, column, or diagonal).

While we don't mind you leverage modern code generation tools, we expect you to fully understand and own 100% of the code and disclose the extent of their use in your workflow.

Requirements

♟️Gameplay
 - Let the player select a board size (n ≥ 4, since below that there are no solutions).
 - Render an interactive n×n chessboard.
 - User can tap to place/remove queens.
 - Provide real-time validation of queen placement and highlight conflicts.
 - Display a win screen when the user successfully solves it.

🎨 UI

 - Dynamic chessboard that can be of different sizes.
 - Queens should be visually clear (♛, image or icon).
 - Conflicting placements should be clearly marked.
 - Simple, extensible and clean design.

💡 Nice-to-haves

 - Show a counter of queens left.
 - Let user restart/reset the game.
 - Store and display best times.
 - Decorate via sfx and animations the queen placement or victory celebration.

📐 Testing & Architecture

 - Focus on lean but strong architecture (your choice).
 - Have a clear testing strategy and strong coverage.
 - Maintain clear separation of UI and logic.
 - During the follow up interview you will walk us through the code and we will build an extension together so feel comfortable with presenting and working on the codebase.

📦 Submission

 - Send the url of a github repo with your solution to your recruiter together with:
 - A README including:
   - How to test/build/run
   - Architecture decisions
   - A short video of your app, feel free to edit it or add a voice over in case you want to improve its presentation.
